# Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of linear search and binary search algorithms in C programming language.

## Files

- **linear_search.c**: Contains the implementation of linear search algorithm.
- **binary_search.c**: Contains the implementation of binary search algorithm.
- **search_utilities.h**: Header file with function declarations and utility macros.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
3. Execute the compiled binary to run the search algorithms.

## Usage

1. To use the linear search algorithm, call `linearSearch` function with the array, size, and search element.
2. To use the binary search algorithm, call `binarySearch` function with the sorted array, size, and search element.
