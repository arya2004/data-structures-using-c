# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C programming language.

## Files

- **sorting_algorithms.c**: Contains the implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort algorithms.
- **sorting_utilities.h**: Header file with function declarations and utility macros.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
3. Execute the compiled binary to run the sorting algorithms.

## Usage

1. Include `sorting_utilities.h` in your C program where sorting algorithms are needed.
2. Call the respective sorting functions (`bubbleSort`, `selectionSort`, `insertionSort`) with the array and its size to sort the array.
