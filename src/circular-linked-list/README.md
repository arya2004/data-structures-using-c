- Deleting the first node of the linked list
- Deleting the last node of the linked list
- Deleting a node at any position in the linked list
- Displaying the elements of the linked list

## Usage

2. Compile your program along with `linked_list_operations.c`.
3. Use the provided functions to perform linked list operations as needed.
