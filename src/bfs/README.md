# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in C

This repository contains an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal using an adjacency matrix representation.

## Files

- `bfs.h`: Header file containing the definition of the BFS function.
- `bfs.c`: Source file containing the implementation of the BFS function.
- `main.c`: Main program file to demonstrate the usage of the BFS function.

## BFS Algorithm

The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm traverses the graph level by level starting from a given node. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit next.

## Usage

Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`):

```bash
gcc main.c bfs.c -o bfs
