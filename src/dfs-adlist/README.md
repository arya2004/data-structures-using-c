# Depth-First Search (DFS) in C Using Adjacency List

This repository contains an implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for graph traversal using an adjacency list representation.

## Files

- `graph_traversal.h`: Header file containing the definitions of the Node structure, Graph structure, Stack structure, and function declarations.
- `graph_traversal.c`: Source file containing the implementation of the functions.
- `main.c`: Main program file to demonstrate the usage of the DFS function.

## DFS Algorithm

The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses the graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The provided implementation uses a stack for the iterative approach.

## Usage

Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`):

```bash
gcc main.c graph_traversal.c -o graph_traversal
