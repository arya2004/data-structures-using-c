## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and programming. They allow us to organize and manage data effectively, optimizing operations such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval. This repository provides a set of header files that implement commonly used data structures.

The goal of this repository is to provide reusable and well-documented code for various data structures, allowing developers to focus on solving higher-level problems without having to reinvent the wheel.

## Available Data Structures

The following data structures are currently implemented in this repository:

- Array
- Linked List
- Douby Linked List
- Stack
- Queue


Each data structure is contained within a separate header file, making it easy to include and use in your own projects.

## Getting Started

To use the data structures in your C projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/arya2004/dataStructures.git
   ```
2. Copy the desired header file(s) from the repository to your project directory.

## Usage

To use a specific data structure in your C program, include the corresponding header file. For example, to use the linked list data structure, add the following line at the top of your source code:

```c
#include "linkedlist.h"
```
